# midinoid
Arduino-based unit for controlling solenoids and other actuators for musical projects with MIDI.

![Fig 1: The midinoid unit](doc/img/midinoid1.JPG)

The midinoid is a 6-channel unit for driving solenoids and other actuators using the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) communication protocol. 
The principle is simple: When it receives a note via a the standard 6-pin MIDI cable, it produces an output current at one of the six output channels that will drive a solenoid, motor, buzzer or whatever is connected to the output. The connected actuators can then produce sounds or initiate another desired effect. See the [Demonstration section](#demonstration) for examples.
